##Legend of the Supersand Saiyan HTML5 game [IN PROGRESS]

Just a little personal project to get familier with ReactJS and have some fun with HTML5 Canvas.
See the current working state of the game [here](https://supersand.herokuapp.com)

##How to run

###Prerequisites

You need Node JS (and npm) installed on your computer. To check, type `npm -v` in a command console and you should get something like `3.8.2` as the output.

###Install

- Git clone the project wherever you fancy
- Bring up a terminal and cd supersand
- type `npm install`
- after a successful installation, type `npm start`. The project should bring up a new browser tab automatically
